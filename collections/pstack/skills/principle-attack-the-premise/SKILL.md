# Attack the Premise

## When to use

Apply when two or more fixes that share one premise have failed the same gate. Take a census of which actors hold the imbalance before the next fix, then question the premise instead of writing another fix that assumes it.

**Do not use when:**
- The trigger in the description is not met
- A narrower operational skill already covers the same decision
- You would only be citing the name without changing a choice

## Intake — before you proceed

You need all of the following. If any is missing, stop.

1. A concrete situation (change, bug, design fork, or review object) that might invoke this principle
2. Enough context to tell whether the trigger actually fires
3. The decision or action this principle would change

If any is missing, stop. Say what is missing and what you need. Do not invent inputs to keep moving.

## HOLD — stop and return this, not a polished guess

When you cannot proceed, return the gap.

| Condition | What is missing | What it needs | Return instead |
|---|---|---|---|
| Trigger unclear | Evidence the trigger fires | A fact from the work that matches the description | Name the gap. Do not cite the principle as decoration. |
| No situation object | A change, bug, fork, or review target | One sentence naming the object | I need the object of work before applying this principle. |
| Would only rename the same plan | A choice the principle actually changes | A different next action, or silence | Holding. Citing without changing a choice is noise. |
| Conflicts with a hard user constraint | Alignment with stated constraints | User confirmation or a different principle | State the conflict. Do not override the user constraint. |

A HOLD is a return value, not a delay before you guess.

## Defaults: cut first

This operation defaults to less, not more.

- Do not expand scope to fully apply the principle
- Prefer the smallest structural change the principle demands
- If the principle says delete, delete before adding
- Do not write an essay about the principle; show the changed choice
- Expansion needs evidence from the request or the observed system — not from a habit of completeness.

## Will not produce

- A decorative citation with no changed decision
- A rewrite of the whole system when a local application suffices
- Invented project facts to make the principle fit

## Before you return

Run this check. If any item fails, fix or HOLD — do not hand over a guess.

- Trigger was evidenced or you HOLDed
- The principle changed a named choice, or you HOLDed
- No decorative citation
- Domain purpose of the surrounding task is unchanged

## What this process changes

The recipe is not a neutral mirror. It changes the work:

- Naming a principle early anchors the agent on that frame and can hide better-fitting principles
- Stop-rules can freeze useful exploration when the census or premise is incomplete
- Delete-first readings can discard still-needed scaffolding if the dead-weight call is wrong

What still needs a human: Whether the trigger truly fired, whether the structural fix is worth the blast radius, and whether to override for a product reason.

## Method card — same family every run

A later agent runs this from this file alone.

1. Intake: situation + trigger evidence + decision to change. Gap -> HOLD.
2. State the trigger match in one sentence.
3. Apply the pattern in the Domain recipe below.
4. Return the changed choice (or HOLD), not a principle lecture.

## Domain recipe

The following is the domain behavior to keep. Alignment sections above constrain intake, pauses, cuts, and refusals; they do not replace this recipe.

When two or more fixes that share one premise have failed the same gate, suspect the premise, not the fixes.

**Why:** Each failure under a shared premise is evidence about the premise.

**Pattern:**
- **Write the premise down.** The premise is the one sentence that every failed fix assumed.
- **Take a census before the next fix.** Count the imbalance per actor. The census shows which actors hold the imbalance, not how large it is. Write the census as a rerunnable script per [Build the Lever](../principle-build-the-lever/SKILL.md).
- **Read the skew.** If the same few actors hold most of the imbalance on every run, something assigns them that role. Find what assigns the role. That assignment is the next "why" per [Fix Root Causes](../principle-fix-root-causes/SKILL.md).
- **Remove the asymmetry instead of compensating for it**, per the [Laziness Protocol](../principle-laziness-protocol/SKILL.md). Rotate the role between actors, randomize the assignment, or move the role, so that no actor holds it on every run. A return path, a shared pool, a batched hand-off, or a periodic rebalance leaves the assignment in place and adds work on every run.

**Stop:**
- Do not start the next fix before the premise is written down and the census exists.
- If the census is even across actors, the premise is not the cause. Look for the cause elsewhere and keep the census as evidence.

This principle is distinct from [Redesign from First Principles](../principle-redesign-from-first-principles/SKILL.md), which rebuilds a design around a new requirement. It questions a fact the current design assumes.

# Why

## When to use

Why does X work this way, design rationale, regressions, postmortems, data-backed thresholds. Companion to how.

**Do not use when:**
- Pure runtime how questions (use how)
- No target can be anchored
- User wants speculative redesign, not an evidence read

## Intake — before you proceed

You need all of the following. If any is missing, stop.

1. Target (code, pattern, feature, or named decision)
2. Question type
3. Code anchor seeds or a path to obtain them

If any is missing, stop. Say what is missing and what you need. Do not invent inputs to keep moving.

## HOLD — stop and return this, not a polished guess

When you cannot proceed, return the gap.

| Condition | What is missing | What it needs | Return instead |
|---|---|---|---|
| Target unresolvable even from context | A referent | File, symbol, or decision name | I need a target. Holding. |
| Cannot establish any code anchor | Paths/symbols/commits | Access to git or pointed files | No anchor. Holding investigators. |
| Would guess a force with no citation | Evidence or an inference label | Source or explicit guess tag | Do not present guesses as facts. |
| User wanted how/runtime | Wrong skill | Route to how | This is a how question. Holding why. |

A HOLD is a return value, not a delay before you guess.

## Defaults: cut first

This operation defaults to less, not more.

- Document null searches; do not skip quietly
- Skip investigators only with written justification
- Synthesize; do not paste dumps
- Expansion needs evidence from the request or the observed system — not from a habit of completeness.

## Will not produce

- Uncited certainty
- Skipping categories without justification
- Readonly Ask mode that strips MCP

## Before you return

Run this check. If any item fails, fix or HOLD — do not hand over a guess.

- Sources consulted section present
- Claims labeled measured/inferred/guess
- Coverage map includes gaps

## What this process changes

The recipe is not a neutral mirror. It changes the work:

- Available MCP set shapes which why stories are findable
- PR descriptions can be post-hoc rationalizations
- Parallel investigators amplify the loudest paper trail

What still needs a human: Which inferred causes to trust, and whether thin trails mean unknown.

## Method card — same family every run

A later agent runs this from this file alone.

1. Parse target -> code anchor -> coverage map -> parallel investigators -> synthesize with epistemics.

## Domain recipe

The following is the domain behavior to keep. Alignment sections above constrain intake, pauses, cuts, and refusals; they do not replace this recipe.

Investigate the motivation and intent behind code.

Companion to the `how` skill. `how` answers what the code does and how it works. `why` answers what forces led to its shape.

## Operating Posture

Operate as a **careful, cautious, and precise investigator**. Be honest about what you know vs what you're inferring. Read `references/epistemics.md` for the full confidence framework and phrasing guide. The synthesizer must follow it.

## Step 1. Understand the Target and the Question

Parse what the user is asking. The **target** is usually a chunk of code, a pattern, a feature, or a named design decision. The **question** is usually a design rationale, a tradeoff, a motivating edge case, an external constraint, dead code, or a broad history sweep.

If the target is vague ("why do we do it this way?" with no clear referent), make your best guess from conversation context (open files, recent edits, cursor location, what was just discussed). State your interpretation briefly so the user can redirect if you're off, then proceed.

## Step 2. Establish the Code Anchor

Before spawning investigators, anchor the investigation in concrete code. You need:

- The relevant file path(s) and line range(s)
- The key symbols (function names, class names, constants)
- An initial commit list. The last few commits touching the target.
- PR numbers from merge commits (pattern `(#1234)` in the subject line)

Build this inline.

```bash
# Blame target lines for last-touch commits
git blame -L <start>,<end> <file>

# Full file history, with patches, through renames
git log --follow -p -- <file>

# Last N commits touching the file, PR numbers visible
git log --oneline -20 -- <file>

# Extract PR numbers from a commit message
git log -1 --format=%B <commit>
```

Pull PR bodies and discussion via `gh` for any substantive commits:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json title,body,author,createdAt,mergedAt,labels,closingIssuesReferences,comments,reviews
```

Capture this as seed context (file paths, symbols, commits, PR numbers, linked ticket IDs). Pass it to the investigators.

## Step 3. Spawn Parallel Investigators (default posture)

**Default to the full parallel investigation.**

### Discovery

Before spawning investigators, list the available MCPs from the Cursor environment. Use the available-tools map when present. Otherwise inspect the `mcps/` directory Cursor exposes for enabled MCP servers.

Map each available MCP to one evidence category:

1. Source control history
2. Issue / ticket tracker
3. Long-form documents
4. Real-time team chat
5. Infrastructure observability
6. Error / exception tracking
7. Product analytics warehouse

Source control is always available through git and `gh`. For the other six, classify using the MCP name, server instructions, tool names, and resource descriptors. If an MCP could fit more than one category, choose the one matching its primary evidence. Record ambiguous cases in the coverage map.

Aim for a complete **coverage map**, not a minimal one. Document the null, don't skip the search.

Launch all matching investigators in a single message so they run concurrently. Don't ask one agent to cover multiple MCPs.

Subagent config (each):
- `subagent_type`: `generalPurpose`
- `model`: your configured why-investigators model (default `grok-4.6-fast-xhigh`)
- `readonly`: `false` (agent mode). **Do not use readonly/Ask mode.** It strips MCP access, which disables MCP-backed investigators entirely. Investigators still shouldn't write anything.

Each investigator gets:
1. The base prompt from `references/investigator-prompt.md`
2. The category playbook `references/sources/<source>.md` for the selected MCP, adapted from the examples in `references/source-playbook.md`
3. The cross-cutting `references/sources/incident-postmortem.md` **if the target code looks defensive** (null checks, retry logic, timeout handling, rate limiting, feature flags, egress guards, OOM handlers)
4. The code anchor from Step 2 (file paths, symbols, commit hashes, PR numbers, ticket IDs)
5. The user's original question

### Investigator roster. One per available evidence category

Spawn one investigator per category that has a matching MCP. Each owns exactly one tool or MCP.

Each entry names the category and the kind of "why" it uniquely surfaces. Use it to know what to expect back, how to name a gap when a category returns empty, and (only in the rare provably-irrelevant case) to justify a skip.

1. **Source control investigator**. Git history, `gh` for PRs, code comments, tests. Always spawn. The only guaranteed source. Best at surfacing *implementation-time rationale captured during review*.

2. **Issue / ticket tracker investigator** (e.g. Linear, Jira, GitHub Issues, Plane, Shortcut MCP). Best at surfacing *the product or business forcing function*. Strongest when the why is external to engineering.

3. **Long-form documents investigator** (e.g. Notion, Confluence, Google Docs, Coda MCP). Best at surfacing *long-form design rationale*. Where the why is written out before it becomes code.

4. **Real-time team chat investigator** (e.g. Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, Mattermost MCP). Best at surfacing *real-time deliberation that never reached a doc*. Especially important when the source control, ticket, and doc paper trail is thin.

5. **Infrastructure observability investigator** (e.g. Datadog, New Relic, Honeycomb, Grafana, Splunk MCP). Infra/runtime view. Best at surfacing *infrastructure and runtime reality that motivated the code*. Strongest when the target reacts to an infra signal (timeouts, retries, rate limits, circuit breakers).

6. **Error / exception tracking investigator** (e.g. Sentry, Rollbar, Bugsnag, Airbrake MCP). Best at surfacing *the specific exceptions and error trajectories that motivated defensive or corrective code*. Strongest for catch blocks, null guards, type checks, retries, and other defenses.

7. **Product analytics warehouse investigator** (e.g. Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, ClickHouse, dbt, Redshift MCP). Product/data view. Best at surfacing *product and data reality that shaped the code*. Strongest for flag-gated code, experiment-driven ships, data migrations, and "where did this number come from" questions.

### When to skip an investigator

Only skip with an **explicit, written justification** that goes in the final "Sources Consulted" section. Two valid reasons:

- **No MCP is available for that category** in this environment. Flag this as a gap, not a choice. Example: "Real-time team chat skipped. No matching MCP available, so the conversational record was not searchable."
- **The source is provably irrelevant**, not just "probably irrelevant." A high bar. Example: "Error / exception tracking skipped. Target is a build-time script with no runtime code path."

If your scope assessment suggests a single-commit trivial target where the PR description already contains the complete answer, you may answer inline **only after** confirming all seven available category searches would be redundant. Say so explicitly. This should be rare.

## Step 4. Synthesize

Spawn one synthesizer subagent:

- `subagent_type`: `generalPurpose`
- `model`: your configured why-synthesizer model (default `claude-fable-5-1-thinking-max`)
- `readonly`: `false` (agent mode). The synthesizer's quality check spot-verifies citations, which can require MCP access. Readonly/Ask mode strips MCPs and defeats that.

The synthesizer gets:
1. The investigator findings, including any null results and any categories skipped with justification
2. The code anchor from Step 2 (file paths, symbols, commit hashes, PR numbers, ticket IDs)
3. The user's original question
4. The epistemics framework from `references/epistemics.md`
5. The synthesizer prompt template from `references/synthesizer-prompt.md`

## Step 5. Present

Take the synthesizer's output and present it to the user. You may lightly edit for clarity or add context from the conversation, but **do not rewrite the confidence language**.

## Output Format

The output structure is the one in `references/synthesizer-prompt.md`: The Question, The Code in Question, What We Found, What We Can Reasonably Infer, Competing Hypotheses, What We Don't Know, Sources Consulted, Confidence Summary. Adapt as needed, but keep the confidence separation intact, and keep Sources Consulted as one line per investigator, including the ones that returned nothing or were skipped, with the reason.

After the Sources Consulted block, if the user's `why` question is a precursor to actually changing this code, convert the lineage findings into a Preserve / Change / Avoid / Risk constraint set suitable for planning the change.

## Common Failure Modes to Avoid

- **Recency bias**. Assuming the most recent commit is authoritative. The current shape is often the accretion of many earlier decisions. Trace back.

## Reference Files

- `references/epistemics.md`. Confidence tiers and phrasing guide. The synthesizer must follow it.
- `references/investigator-prompt.md`. Base prompt template for investigator subagents.
- `references/source-playbook.md`. Index pointing at the category playbooks below.
- `references/sources/*.md`. One self-contained example playbook per category, plus cross-cutting `incident-postmortem.md`. Give an investigator the single file that matches its category and adapt it to the available MCP.
- `references/synthesizer-prompt.md`. Prompt template for the synthesizer subagent, including the output format.
